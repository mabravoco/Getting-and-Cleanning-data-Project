# Getting and Cleaning Data Week Project

Github repository for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" Week 4 project. 

Contains

run_analysis.R code for getting, cleaning input data and create the tidydata.txt output
codebook: High level descriptin of process and variables.
tidydata.txt: output data

tidyData.txt is the output of the final step

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
